# Bitcoin-Derivatives-Bot
This project is an AI-enhanced Bitcoin reversal trading bot designed for Coinbase Advanced Futures. It identifies high-probability trend reversal setups (long or short) using a combination of:

Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, candlestick patterns)

Volume & order book analysis (OBV, stop runs, liquidity grabs)

Sentiment filters (Fear & Greed Index, social/news spikes)

Dynamic risk management (confidence-based position sizing, stop-loss logic, and R:R optimization)

The bot starts with a rule-based core strategy and evolves into a modular AI system — integrating machine learning (LSTM, classifiers) and potentially reinforcement learning to adapt in real-time. It includes full support for:

Environment setup & dependency management

Backtesting with historical futures data

Live trading via Coinbase Advanced API (REST/WebSocket)

Logging, monitoring, and adaptive strategy logic

Focused on mean-reversion and exhaustion plays, the bot is engineered to think like a contrarian — patient, data-driven, and capital-aware.
